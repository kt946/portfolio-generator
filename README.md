# portfolio-generator

## Description

This is a Node.js application that enables developers to generate their own portfolio HTML page by typing in responses to questions from the command line. I built this project to make it easier for developers to quickly put their information, experiences, and projects into an HTML file. Instead of having to build their own HTML and CSS files, which can be time-consuming, this application will instead ask questions and accept responses from the command line and then output that data into a completed HTML file. Through this project, I learned more about Node.js, Node Package Manager (npm), JavaScript ES6, and asynchronous JavaScript code.

## Installation

To install this project: 

1. Clone the repository into a directory on your local computer. 

2. Access your computer's command line and navigate to the portfolio-generator root directory containing the app.js file. 

3. In the command line, type either 'node app' or 'node app.js'.

When accessed, you will see a message in the terminal asking the first question of the application ("What is your name?"). Once you have completed all of the prompts, a message inform you that the finished portfolio HTML file has been created in the 'dist' directory.
